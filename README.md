# Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. A testing Framework (Jasmine) is used to write tests that ensure error-free running of the application.

## How to run this application:
1. Simply clone the repo and run the index.html file in the root directory.
2. Alternatively, you can also find the app [here.](https://riteshthakur961.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/)
